## 💻 How to Use

1. **Install a Roblox Executor**:  
   Before you can use Infinix, you'll need to install an exploit executor. Some popular executors include **Argon**, **Velocity**, and **Wave**. Make sure to use a reliable and compatible executor for the best experience.

2. **Load the Infinix Script**:  
   Open your executor, and in the script editor, paste the following code to load Infinix:

   ```lua
   ---- Settings ----
   _G.Translator = false -- True to translate to PT-BR / True para traduzir para PT-BR
   _G.FixRead = false -- For Velocity only. If the script doesn't work, set true and run it again / Apenas para Velocity. Caso o script não funcione, coloque para true e execute novamente.
   -------------------

   ---- Load script ----
   loadstring(game:HttpGet("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Baconamassado/Infinix/refs/heads/main/Infinix-Script-Hub"))()
